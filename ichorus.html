        <h2>Backstory</h2>
        <p>
            Ichorus was born to a desert tribe of wandering Hobgoblins. As the firstborn of his parents, he was offered up as tribute to a pair of witches in exchange for the tribe's protection. He was raised by the witches to become a warlock that they could use to take power. At Ichorus's coming of age they took him to the domain of Dao, an earth genie residing deep in the desert, to gain his patronage. After forming their pact, the genie informed Ichorus that he had been watching him with great interest, and revealed the truth of his origins. His parents had actually refused to give tribute to the witches, and so the witches used their magic to slaughter his tribe. Ichorus was the lone survivor, kept as a trophy. Ichorus' wrath kindled against his foster parents, he hatched a plan of revenge and, in the night, killed the witches.

        <h3>Blood Hunter Features (Order of the Profane Soul)</h3>
        <h4>Genie (Dao)</h4>
        <h5>Vessel: Ornate Lantern</h5>
        <h6>Bottled Respite</h6>
        <p>As an action, you can magically vanish and enter your vessel, which remains in the space you left. The interior of the vessel is an extradimensional space in the shape of a 20-foot-radius cylinder, 20 feet high, and resembles your vessel. The interior is appointed with cushions and low tables and is a comfortable temperature. While inside, you can hear the area around your vessel as if you were in its space. You can remain inside the vessel up to a number of hours equal to twice your proficiency bonus. You exit the vessel early if you use a bonus action to leave, if you die, or if the vessel is destroyed. When you exit the vessel, you appear in the unoccupied space closest to it. Any objects left in the vessel remain there until carried out, and if the vessel is destroyed, every object stored there harmlessly appears in the unoccupied spaces closest to the vessel's former space. Once you enter the vessel, you can't enter again until you finish a long rest.</p>

        <h6>Genie's Wrath</h6>
        <p>Once during each of your turns when you hit with an attack roll, you can deal extra thunder (dao) damage to the target equal to your proficiency bonus.</p>

        <p>The vessel's AC equals your spell save DC. Its hit points equal your warlock level plus your proficiency bonus, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. If the vessel is destroyed or you lose it, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and the previous vessel is destroyed if it still exists. The vessel vanishes in a flare of elemental power when you die.</p>

        <h5>Rite Focus</h5>
        <p>Starting at 3rd level, your weapon becomes a conduit for the power of your pact with your chosen patron. While you have an active crimson rite, you can use your weapon as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells, and you gain a specific benefit based on your chosen pact.</p>
        <h6>The Genie</h6>
        <p>As a bonus action, you expend a use of your Blood Maledict feature to give yourself a flying speed of 30 feet, which lasts for a number of rounds equal to your Hemocraft modifier (minimum of 1 round).</p>
