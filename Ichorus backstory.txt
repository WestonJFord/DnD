Ichorus was born to a desert tribe of wandering Hobgoblins. As the firstborn of his parents, he was offered up as tribute to a pair of witches in exchange for the tribe's protection. He was raised by the witches to become a warlock that they could use to take power. At Ichorus's coming of age they took him to the domain of Dao, an earth genie residing deep in the desert, to gain his patronage. After forming their pact, the genie informed Ichorus that he had been watching him with great interest, and revealed the truth of his origins. His parents had actually refused to give tribute to the witches, and so the witches used their magic to slaughter his tribe. Ichorus was the lone survivor, kept as a trophy. Ichorus' wrath kindled against his foster parents, he hatched a plan of revenge and, in the night, killed the witches.
